# Dockerized VDE setup
This a dockerized automized setup of the VirtualSquare (VDE & co.) experimental software, and is only intended for testing and learning purposes, not for running real stuff.  
Just run `docker build -t vsquare .` to build a named container, and `docker run -ti vsquare` to run it.  

# Credits
Simone Preite for the setup script (99% of the job).
